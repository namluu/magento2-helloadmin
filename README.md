Namluu_Helloadmin module functionality is represented by the following sub-systems:
 - Backend controller.  e.g: http://magento240.local:81/admin_evo7w4/helloadmin
 - 

For development purposes, it is recommended that we remove the secret key (the hash in
the URL) from the admin URLs. You can configure this in Stores | Configuration |
Advanced | Admin | Security
